# Forgery with GANs
Creating fakes with Generative Adversarial Networks

## About GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs has two parts two it.
1. Generator - a counterfeiter that keeps on generating out of nothing (noise)
2. Discriminator - an adversary that distinguishes real data from the fake one.
The idea is to have both the networks trained such that the generator becomes good at creating original fakes and so does the discriminator in identifying them.
